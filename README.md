## How to Use

Follow the steps below to use the **Secret Santa** project:

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**

   You can obtain the project code in two ways:

   - **Clone the repository via Git**:

     ```

2. **Open the Project in Your Browser**

   After getting the project files, open the `index.html` file directly in your preferred browser. There is no need to set up servers or install additional dependencies, as the project is designed to run locally in the browser.

3. **Add Friends' Names**

   1. In the **"Enter a name"** input field, type the name of a friend who will participate in the draw.

   2. Click the **Add** button to include the name in the friends list.

   Each newly added name will automatically appear in the list just below the input field.

4. **View the Friends List**

   After adding friendsâ€™ names, the friends list will be dynamically updated below the input field. The list shows all added friends, allowing you to review the participants before performing the draw.

5. **Perform the Draw**

   2. The application will randomly assign Secret Santas and display the results on the screen.

   The draw results will be clearly shown, indicating who is each participant's Secret Santa.

6. **Common Issues and Solutions**

   - **"The friends list is empty!"**: This error occurs if you try to perform the draw without adding any friends. To fix this, add at least two friends to the list before clicking **Draw friend**.

   - **"Please enter a valid name."**: This error occurs if the name input field is left empty or contains only whitespace. Make sure the input field contains a valid name before clicking **Add**.
